                        The proposal aims to enhance the safety and security of students at IIT Kharagpur by introducing
                        a program that will increase awareness and education among students. While IIT Kharagpur is
                        already a safe community for students, this program will further improve the safety measures.
                        <br><br>

                        The primary focus of the proposed program is to raise awareness about sexual harassment and
                        educate students about the issue. The program will highlight the importance of reporting such
                        incidents and seeking help if required. The aim is to create a safe and inclusive environment
                        for all students, regardless of their gender, by empowering them with knowledge and resources to
                        combat any form of harassment.

                        <br><br>
                        The proposed program will also strengthen the effectiveness of the Internal Complaints Committee
                        (ICC) and Women Student Representatives. By educating students about their rights and the role
                        of the ICC, the program will increase the likelihood of students reporting incidents of sexual
                        harassment. This, in turn, will aid in the prevention of such incidents and ensure a timely
                        response to any reports.

                        <br><br>
                        Overall, this proposal seeks to establish a comprehensive program that promotes awareness and
                        education about sexual harassment among students at IIT Kharagpur. By doing so, it aims to
                        create a safe and inclusive environment for all students, while also strengthening the
                        effectiveness of the ICC.

                                Introduction of a mandatory Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) Training for all
                                students across the campus.

                                The training workshops would be conducted in partnership with a certified PoSH training
                                agency. These workshops would include a short series of live lectures and an assessment
                                to understand the efficacy of the program. Upon successful completion of the assessment,
                                a certificate from the training agency would be issued for the student.

                                The proposed program to enhance safety and security at IIT Kharagpur through increased
                                awareness and education about sexual harassment is likely to have a significant impact
                                on the student community.

                            <li>
                                By providing mandatory Prevention of Sexual Harassment (PoSH) training for all students,
                                the program will empower students with the knowledge and resources to recognise and
                                combat any form of harassment. This would create a safer and more inclusive environment
                                for all students, regardless of their gender.

                                The proposed partnership with a certified PoSH training agency would ensure the quality
                                and effectiveness of the training program.
                            </li>
                            <li>Additionally, making it mandatory for each member of the Internal Complaints Committee
                                (ICC) to undergo the PoSH training program would strengthen the effectiveness of the
                                committee. It would ensure that the committee members are well-equipped to handle any
                                complaints of sexual harassment and ensure that justice is served in a timely and
                                efficient manner.

                        The IIT Kharagpur community prides itself on its inclusivity and acceptance of individuals from
                        all backgrounds. However, there is a need to equip the campus to handle mental health issues
                        effectively.
                        <br><br>
                        It is essential to recognize that members of the LGBTQIA+ community face unique challenges and
                        stressors that require specialised attention. The proposal aims to put some focus on the
                        importance of special training for counsellors towards LGBTQIA+ issues. This training will help
                        counsellors understand the specific needs and challenges of the LGBTQIA+ community and provide
                        appropriate support and guidance.
