                An initiative aimed at encouraging the women entrepreneurs to start their own businesses by enhancing
                their abilities, providing guidance and support through mentoring, networking, and enabling practical
                learning opportunities. Entrepreneurial events conducted in the institute has observed lesser women
                participation. To increase the women participation, I plan to host a boot camp that caters exclusively
                to female entrepreneurs.The Boot Camp will serve as a platform to create awareness about the benefits of
                entrepreneurship and the various opportunities available for women in this field. By creating a
                supportive environment and providing access to valuable resources, the Boot Camp aims to inspire and
                enable women to become successful entrepreneurs.

                        I propose to organise a week-long Boot Camp for women entrepreneurs, designed to empower them by
                        enhancing their skills, and providing guidance and support through mentoring, networking, and
                        practical learning opportunities.

                    <li>
                        I propose to bring in women speakers, mentors, investors in the guest lectures, pitching and
                        mentoring sessions, where women participants will have the chance to gain real-life experience
                        by presenting their ideas to a panel of investors and mentors.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                I will be conducting a week-long Boot Camp which will consist of a series of guest lectures, workshops,
                and mentoring sessions to help the women entrepreneurs to attain relevant skills. The key is to provide
                a mix of expert insights, practical workshops, and personalised mentoring sessions to help participants
                refine their business ideas, validate their business models, and prepare for potential investment and
                growth. I am planning to fund the Boot Camp through a company-led CSR initiative, and am currently in
                process of shortlisting companies that may be willing to provide dedicated funding for the same.

                The proposed Boot Camp has the potential to have a significant impact on the women participants and
                their businesses. It can improve women participants' knowledge and skills related to legal
                considerations, refining business ideas, validating business models, and attracting investment. It can
                also expand their network, increase their confidence, and provide an opportunity for potential
                investment and growth. Further, this program will boost women's participation in various
                startup-oriented competitions, and hackathons, and will encourage them to pursue their own businesses.

                        <li>Speaking with some of the current executive heads of Entrepreneurship Cell, IIT Kharagpur, I
                            inquired about any potential overlap between the year-long initiatives of Entrepreneurship
                            Cell and the proposed Boot Camp.</li>
                        <li>The Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited has undertaken a similar CSR initiative at the Indian
                            Institute of Management Bangalore, for funding the Women Startup Program.
                        </li>
                        <li>I intend to reach out to corporations such as HUL, ICICI Bank, ITC, Bandhan Bank that
                            allocate their CSR funds towards women's education, and entrepreneurship awareness.</li>
                        <li>I have had conversations with representatives from IIT Bombay and IIM Bangalore, both of
                            whom administer programs aimed at promoting women entrepreneurship.</li>
