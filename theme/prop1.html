                        Research scholars at IIT Kharagpur face several challenges related to
                        the alignment of their academic cycle, delayed exams, lack of
                        formalised contingency funds, and absence of concrete introduction and
                        awareness about campus placements. These challenges can negatively
                        impact their income, academic progress, and career prospects.

                    <div class="proposal_content">
                        To address these challenges, the following actions have been proposed:
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Standard Operating Procedure: A standard operating procedure will
                                be set up to clarify the academic tenure of the research scholars.
                                This includes formulation of rules and norms regarding the conduct
                                of various evaluative measures for the scholars.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Feedback System: A feedback system will be put in place for the
                                research scholars to improve their academic life at IIT Kharagpur.
                                This system will allow scholars to provide feedback on their
                                academic experiences, including suggestions for improvement.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                exams and seminars will be established for their comprehensive
                                exams, registration seminars, and enhancement seminars. This will
                                ensure that these exams and seminars are conducted on time and do
                                not delay the progress of research scholars.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Standard List: A standard list will be issued for an effective use
                                of the contingency funds. This will provide clear guidelines on
                                how research scholars can use these funds and will help prevent
                                any misuse.

                        The proposed measures will have the following impacts:

                                Improved Academic Life: Having clarity on their academic tenure
                                and prior information of their exams and seminars schedule will
                                lead to a greatly improved academic life for the research scholars
                                at IIT Kharagpur.

                                Consistent Income: The proposed measures will ensure that the
                                income of the research scholars is not affected due to delayed
                                exams and seminars. This will be particularly helpful for the
                                married research scholars who need a more consistent source of
                                income.

                                sufficient for their academic tenure.
