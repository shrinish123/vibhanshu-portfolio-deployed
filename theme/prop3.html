                    <li>IIT Kharagpur has a rich tradition of fostering innovative research and development across a
                        wide range of disciplines. However, the process of finding and participating in research
                        projects can be challenging for undergraduate students, particularly those who are not familiar
                        with the research landscape. The existing process of finding the right research project can be
                        tedious, involving a long search for available opportunities and a series of cold emails. This
                        often leads to students being unable to find a professor working in their field of interest,
                        which can be discouraging.
                    </li>
                    <li>To address this issue and promote greater engagement with research among undergraduate students,
                        I propose to launch a structured program to channel undergraduate research at IIT Kharagpur. My
                        aim is to create a centralised platform where undergraduate students can easily find available
                        research opportunities and connect with professors who are conducting research in their field of
                        interest. By doing so, I hope to streamline the research process for undergraduate students,
                        increase their engagement with research, and create a more conducive environment for innovation
                        and development at IIT Kharagpur.</li>

                        The program will offer research opportunities for undergraduate students, with stipends being
                        provided by the professors based on the projects. As the program progresses, the possibility of
                        additional funding through alumni and government-funded programs can also be explored.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The program will span nine months, with the research period taking place from May to July. To
                        ensure that students have access to high-quality research opportunities, the program will be
                        structured with a preparatory phase, during which students can apply for

                        available projects. The application window will be open from January to February, with the
                        selection process taking place in March.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To kick-start the program, in November of the preceding year, all professors will be asked for
                        their willingness to participate in the program. Based on their responses, a list of research
                        projects will be created, and students will be invited to apply for projects that align with
                        their interests. The selection process will be based on academic merit, prior experience, and
                        demonstrated interest in the research area.

                        This program aims to channel undergraduate research at IIT Kharagpur and provide students with
                        the opportunity to pursue summer research projects under the guidance of experienced professors.
                        This will welcome students from both within and outside of IIT Kharagpur to apply for this
                        program and benefit from the rich research culture of our institution.

                        The goal of this program is to increase the number of undergraduate students who participate in
                        research activities at IIT Kharagpur and to help facilitate the development of the next
                        generation of researchers and innovators. By streamlining the research process and making it
                        more accessible, we can encourage more students to pursue research and contribute to the ongoing
                        advancements in their respective fields.

                        Professors would have access to a larger pool of interested and motivated undergraduate students
                        who are looking to gain research experience. This would provide professors with a wider range of
                        potential research assistants to choose from and could also help to identify students who are
                        particularly passionate or skilled in a particular field.

                    <li>
                        By creating a more streamlined and accessible research process for undergraduate students, IIT
                        Kharagpur will establish itself as a leading institution for research and innovation at the
                        national level. This would not only help to attract more talented undergraduate students to the
                        institution but could also increase the number of high-quality applicants for M.Tech. and Ph.D.
                        programs.

                    <li>I engaged with the students at IIT Kanpur and IIT Roorkee, both of which offer similar programs
                        - SURGE and SPARK. I discovered the many benefits they receive, including early exposure to
                        research and high-quality learning opportunities.
                    </li>
                    <li>I contacted Mr. Abhishek Singh, Project Engineer at SURGE, IIT Kanpur, and Mr. Yash Gupta,
                        Student developer at SPARK, IIT Roorkee, to learn more about the program structure and got many
                        insights related to stipend allocation, selection process, and external participation in the
                        program.</li>
                    <li>To gauge the interest of faculty members in such a program, I conducted meetings with various
                        professors at IIT Kharagpur. The response was positive, with many expressing their enthusiasm
                        for the program and willingness to float their projects.</li>
                    <li>I conducted discussions with undergraduate students at IIT Kharagpur from various research
                        backgrounds. They expressed difficulties in identifying available research opportunities,
                        connecting with professors who are conducting research in their field of interest, and
                        navigating the application process.</li>
